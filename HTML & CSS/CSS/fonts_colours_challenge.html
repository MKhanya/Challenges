            <p>All that is told here happened some time before<br>
            Mowgli was turned out of the Seeonee Wolf Pack, or<br>
            revenged himself on Shere Khan the tiger. It was in the<br>
            days when Baloo was teaching him the Law of the Jungle.</p>
            <p>The big, serious, old brown bear was delighted to have so<br>
            quick a pupil, for the young wolves will only learn as<br>
            much of the Law of the Jungle as applies to their own<br>
            pack and tribe, and run away as soon as they can repeat<br>
            the Hunting Verse - 'Feet that makes no noise; eyes that<br>
            can see in the dark; ears that can hear the winds in their<br>
            lairs, and sharp white teeth, all these things are the marks<br>
            of our brothers except Tabaqui the Jackal and the Hyaena<br>
            whom we hate.' But Mowgli , as a man-cub, had to learn a<br>
            great deal more than this. Sometimes Bagheera the Black<br>
            Panther would come lounging through the jungle to see<br>
            how his pet was getting on, and would purr with his head<br>
            against a tree while Mowgli recited the day's lesson to <br>
            Baloo. The boy would climb almost as well as he could<br>
            swim, and swim almost as well as he could run. So Baloo,<br>
            the Teacher of the Law, taught him the Wood and Water.</br></p>
            <p>Laws: how to tell a rotten branch from a sound one; how<br>
            to speak politely  to the wild bees when he came upon a<br>
             hive of them fifty feet above ground; what to say to Mang<br>
            the Bat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday;<br>
            and how to warn the water-snakes in the pools before he<br>
            splashed down among them. None of the Jungle People<br>
            like being disturbed, and all are veryy ready to at an<br>
            intruder. Then, too, Mowgli was taught the Strangers'<br>
            Hunting Call, which must be repeated aloud till it is <br>
            answered, whenever one of the Jungle-People hunts<br>
            outside his own grounds. It means, translated. 'Give me<br>
            leave to hunt here because I am hungry.' And the answer<br>
            is, 'Hunt then for food, but not for pleasure.'</p>
            <p>All this will show you how much Mowgli had to learn<br>
            by heart, and he grew very tired of saying the same thing<br>
            over a hundred times. But, as Baloo said to Bagheera, one<br>
            day when Mowgli had been cuffed and run off in a<br>
            temper,'A man's cub is a man's cub, and he must learn all<br>
            the LAw of the Jungle.'</p>
            <p>'But think how small he is,' said the Black Panther,<br>
            who would have spoiled Mowgli if he had had his own<br>
            way.' How can his little head carry thy long talk?'</p>

            <h3 align="center">Is there anything</h3>

            <p>'Is there anything in the jungle too kid to be killed?<br>
            No. That is why I teach him these things, and that is why<br>
            I hit him, very softly, when he forgets,'</br></p>
            <p>'Softly! What does thou know of softness, old Iron-<br>
            feet?' Bagheera grunted. 'His face is all bruised today by<br>
        thy-softness. Ugh.'</br></p>
        <p>Better he should be bruised from head to foot by me<br>
        who love him than that he should come to harm through<br>
        ignorance,' Baloo answered very earnestly. 'I am now<br>
        teaching him the Master Words of the Jungle that shall<br>
        protect him with the birds and the Snake People, and all<br>
        that hunt on four feet, except his own pack. He can now<br>
        claim protection, if he will only remember the words,<br>
        from all in the jungle. Is not that worth a little beating?'<br></p>
        <p>'Well, look to it then that thou dost not kill the man-<br>
        cub. He is no tree trunk to sharpe thy blunt claws upon.<br>
        But what are those Master Words? i am more likely to<br>
        give help than to ask it'-Bagheera stretched out one paw<br>
        and admired the steel-blue, ripping -chisel talond at the end<br>
        of it-'still I shoudld like to know.'</br></p>
        <p>'I will call Mowgli and shall say them-if he will.<br>
        Come, Little Brother!'</br></p>

        <h3 align="center">My head is</h3>
        <p>'My head is ringing like a bee tree,'said a sullen little<br>
        voice over their heads, and Mowgli slid down a tree trunk<br>
        very angry and indignant, adding as he reached the<br>
        ground: 'I come for Bagheera and not for thee, fat old<br>
        Baloo!'</br></p>
        <p>'That is all one to me,' said Baloo, though he was hurt<br>
        and grieved. 'Tell Bagheera, then, the Master Words of<br>
        the Jungle that I have taught thee this day.'</br> </p>
        <p>Master Wordsfor which people?' said Mowgli,<br>
        delighted to show off. The jungle has many tongues. I<br>
        know them all.'</br></p>
        <p>'All little thou knowest, but not much. See, O Bagheera,<br>
        they never thank their their teacher. Not one small wolfing has<br>
        ever come back to thank old Baloo for his teachings. Say<br>
        the word for the Hunting-People, then-great scholar.'<br>
        'We be of one blood, ye and I,' said Mowgli,giving<br>
        the words the Bear accent which all the Hunting People<br>
        use.</br></p>
            <p>'Good. Now for the birds.'
                Mowgli repeated, with the Kite's whistle at the end of<br>
                the sentence.</br>
                'Now for thr Snake-People,' said Bagheera.<br>
                The answer wa perfectly indescribable hiss, and<br>
                Mowgli kicked up his feet behind, clapped his hands<br>
                together to applaud himself, and jumped on to Bagheera's<br>
                back, where he sat sideways, drumming with his heels on<br>
                the glossy skin and making the worst faceshe could thing<br>
                of at Baloo</br>
            </p>
        <h3 align="center">'There-there!</h3>
        <p>'There-there! That was worth a little bruise,' said the<br>
        brown bear tenderly. 'Some day thou wilt remember me.'<br>
        Then he turned aside to tell Bagheera how he had begged <br>
        the Master Words from Hathi the Wild Elephant, who<br>
        knows all about these things, and how Hathi had  taken<br>
        Mowgli down to a pool to get thr Snake Word from a<br>
        water-snakes, because Baloo could not pronounce it, and <br>
        how Mowgli was now reasonably safe against all accidents<br>
        in the jungle, because neither snake, bird, nor beast would<br>
        hurt him.</br></p>
        <p>'No one then is to be feared,' Baloo would up, patting<br>
        his big furry stomach with pride.<br>
        'Excpet his own tribe,' said Bagheera, under his breath;<br>
        and then aloud to Mowgli, 'Have a care for my ribs, Little<br>
        Brother! What is all this dancing up and down?<br></p>
        <p>Mowgli had been trying to make himself heard by<br>
        pulling at Bagheera's shoulder fur and kicking hard. When<br>
        the two listened  to him he was shouting  at the top of his<br>
        voice, 'And so I shall have a tribe of my own, and lead<br>
        them through the branches all day long.'</br></p>
        <p>'What is this new folly, little dreamer of dreams?' said<br>
        Bagheera.<br>
        'Yes, and throw branches and dirt at old Baloo,'<br>
        Mowgli went on. 'They have promised me this. Ah!<br>
        'Whoof!  Baloo's big paw scooped Mowgli off<br>
        Bagheera's back, and as the boy lay between the big for-<br>
        paws he could see the Bear was angry.<br></p>
        <p>'Mowgli,' said Baloo,'thou hast been talking with the<br>
        Bandar-log-the Monkey People.'<br>
        Mowgli looked at Bagheera to see if the Panther was<br>
        angry too, and Bagheera's eyes were as hard as jade stones.<br>
        'Thou hast been with the Monkey People-the gray<br>
        apes-the people without a law-the eaters of everything.<br>
        That is great shame.'<br></p>

        <h3 align="center">'When Baloo hurt...'</h3>
        <p>'When Baloo hurt my head,' said Mowgli (he was still<br>
        on his back), 'I went away, and the gray apes came down<br>
        from the trees and had pity on me. No one else cared.' He <br>
         snuffled a little.</br></p>
         <p>'The pity of the Monkey People!' Baloo snorted. 'The<br>
        stillness of the mountain stream! The coolof the summer<br>
        sun! And then, man-cub?'<br></p>
        <p>'And then, and then, they gave me nuts and pleasant<br>
        things to eat, and they-they carried me in their arms up<br>
        to the top of the trees and said I was their blood brother<br>
        except that I had no tail, and should be their leader some<br>
        day.'</p>
